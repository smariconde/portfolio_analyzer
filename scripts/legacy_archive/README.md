# Legacy Scripts

These scripts were archived during the unification refactor to reduce duplicated flows in the main UX.

- `sharpe.py` -> replaced by `src/portfolio_analyzer/analytics/sortino.py`
- `scrapper.py` -> replaced by `scripts/scrapper_diario.py` and `src/portfolio_analyzer/data/commodities.py`
- `optimizacion_genetico.py` -> replaced by `scripts/optimal_portfolio.py` and `src/portfolio_analyzer/analytics/optimizer.py`

Compatibility wrappers now live in `scripts/legacy/`.
